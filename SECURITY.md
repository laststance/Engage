## üîí Security Measures

This project implements multiple layers of security protection to ensure the safety and integrity of the application and its dependencies.

### 1. Aikido Safe Chain - Malware Protection

We use [Aikido Safe Chain](https://github.com/AikidoSec/safe-chain) to protect against malicious packages during dependency installation in our CI/CD pipeline.

#### Features

- ‚úÖ **Free to use** - No tokens or authentication required
- üõ°Ô∏è **Malware detection** - Blocks malicious packages before installation
- üîç **Threat intelligence** - Uses Aikido Intel - Open Source Threat Intelligence
- üì¶ **Multi-package manager support** - npm, pnpm, yarn, npx, pnpx
- üöÄ **Node.js 18+** compatible

#### Implementation

Aikido Safe Chain is integrated into all GitHub Actions workflows that install dependencies:

- **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`) - Protects lint, typecheck, test, and build jobs
- **Security Workflow** (`security.yml`) - Protects dependency audit jobs
- **Quality Workflow** (`quality.yml`) - Protects coverage and bundle analysis jobs
- **E2E Workflow** (`e2e.yml`) - Protects E2E test jobs
- **Release Workflow** (`release.yml`) - Protects deployment jobs
- **Safe Chain Workflow** (`safe-chain.yml`) - Dedicated malware scanning workflow

#### How It Works

1. Installs `@aikidosec/safe-chain` globally in the CI environment
2. Runs `safe-chain setup-ci` before dependency installation
3. Intercepts and scans all package installations
4. Blocks malicious packages before they can be installed
5. Uses open source threat intelligence to identify risks

#### Note on pnpm Support

Currently, Aikido Safe Chain offers **limited scanning for pnpm** (scans install command arguments). Full dependency tree scanning for pnpm is coming soon according to the official roadmap.

### 2. Automated Security Scanning

#### CodeQL Analysis

- **What**: Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **When**: On push/PR to main, weekly schedule
- **Scope**: JavaScript/TypeScript code
- **Queries**: Security-extended, security-and-quality

#### Dependency Review

- **What**: Reviews new/changed dependencies in PRs
- **When**: On pull requests
- **Action**: Fails on moderate+ severity vulnerabilities
- **License blocking**: GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0

#### Dependency Audit

- **What**: Scans for vulnerable dependencies using pnpm audit
- **When**: On push/PR to main, before releases
- **Action**: Fails on high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Protected by**: Aikido Safe Chain malware scanning

#### Secret Scanning

- **What**: Detects secrets in commit history
- **Tool**: TruffleHog
- **When**: On push/PR to main
- **Scope**: Only verified secrets reported

### 3. Dependabot

Automated dependency updates with security patches:

- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 9 AM JST
- **Ecosystems**: npm, GitHub Actions
- **Grouping**: Production and dev dependencies grouped separately
- **Auto-labels**: `dependencies`, `automated`

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email the security team at: [security contact - to be added]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 24-48 hours
  - High: Within 1 week
  - Medium: Within 2 weeks
  - Low: Within 1 month

## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Use GitHub secrets for CI/CD
   - Check files before committing

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Review and approve Dependabot PRs promptly
   - Test dependency updates locally
   - Check for breaking changes

3. **Follow secure coding practices**
   - Validate user input
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid eval() and similar functions
   - Follow OWASP guidelines

4. **Review security scan results**
   - Address CodeQL findings
   - Fix dependency vulnerabilities
   - Don't ignore security warnings

### For Maintainers

1. **Review security alerts promptly**
   - Check GitHub Security tab regularly
   - Prioritize high/critical vulnerabilities
   - Test fixes before deployment

2. **Protect sensitive workflows**
   - Restrict workflow permissions
   - Use repository secrets
   - Enable branch protection

3. **Monitor CI/CD security**
   - Review Safe Chain reports
   - Check audit logs
   - Verify successful security scans

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Workflows

### Daily Security Checks

```bash
# Run local security checks
pnpm audit                 # Check for vulnerable dependencies
pnpm lint                  # Check for code quality issues
pnpm typecheck            # Verify type safety
```

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing code:

1. Run security scans locally
2. Verify no secrets in code
3. Check dependency updates
4. Run full test suite

### Release Security

Before every release:

1. All security workflows must pass
2. No high/critical vulnerabilities
3. Dependencies up to date
4. Security scan artifacts reviewed
